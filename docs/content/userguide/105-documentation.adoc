== Documentation

=== Overview

The documentation is writen in http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html[AsciiDoc^] which is a plain-text markup format that
can be created using any text editor and read “as-is”, or rendered to several other formats like HTML, PDF or EPUB.

=== Ordering

All of the content stored in the `docs/content` directory of this project will be rendered into a single web page with
an auto-generated table of contents and a PDF. The order in which the pages appear is determined by the sort order of
the file names given to the ASCIIDOC files in the `docs/content` directory so a numeric prefix has been given to each
file. Gaps can be left in between the numbers (only the sort order is important) to allow for future edits without having
to renumber other documents that will appear after the new content.

=== Preview

To preview markup as HTML before making a commit there are plugins available various text editors and IDEs that
can be used while editing. If your preferred text editor has no plugin available there's a
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-firefox-addon[Firefox AsciiDoc Plugin^] available which allows for previewing
with a quick refresh of the browser.


=== Transformation

To preview the entire finished web page or see the generated PDF you'll need to run the transformation process.

[source, bash]
.Generate Documentation
----
 cd geowave
 mvn -P html install <1> <2>
----
<1> To generate the documentation in pdf form use the pdf profile instead of the html profile.
<2> You can speed up the build by skipping tests by adding -Dfindbugs.skip=true -Dformatter.skip=true -DskipITs=true -DskipTests=true

The source documents will be transformed and will be available for inspection in the `geowave/target/site/` directory.

=== Javadocs

[source, bash]
.Generate Javadocs
----
cd geowave
mvn -q javadoc:aggregate
----

The Javadocs will be available for inspection in the `geowave/target/site/apidocs` directory.
